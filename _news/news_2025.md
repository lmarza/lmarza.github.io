&emsp;**February** 

- The journal extension of our paper *"Rigorous Probabilistic Guarantees for Robust Counterfactual Explanations"* in collaboration with <a href='https://fraleo.github.io'>Francesco Leofante</a> of <a href='https://www.imperial.ac.uk/explainable-artificial-intelligence/'> Centre for Explainable AI</a> is out! Read it <a href='https://www.researchgate.net/publication/389435880_Probabilistically_Robust_Counterfactual_Explanations_under_Model_Changes)'>here</a>ðŸš€ 

- RobustX is out!ðŸš€ A new Python library to generate robust counterfactual explanations! Check out the <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.13751'>paper</a> and the <a href='https://github.com/RobustCounterfactualX/RobustX'>code</a> made in collaboration with Imperial College people!


&emsp;**January** 

- Our proposal on "Tackling Environmental Sustainability Challenges via Reinforcement Learning and Counterfactual Explanations" has been accepted for discussion at the AAAI 2025 Bridge on Explainable AI, Energy, and Critical Infrastructure Systems. Looking forward to engaging discussions on Explainable AI for environmental sustainability!

- Our paper <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.08315'>Improving Policy Optimization via Îµ-Retrain</a> made during my research period at CMU under the supervision of <a href='https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/changliu-liu/'>Prof. Changliu Liu</a>, has been accepted at AAMAS 2025 ðŸ¤© Happy to have collaborated with <a href='https://emarche.github.io'>Enrico Marchesini</a> and <a href='https://priyadonti.com'>Prof. Priya Donti</a> of the Laboratory for Information & Decision Systems at MIT for this project!
