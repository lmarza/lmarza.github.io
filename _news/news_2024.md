&emsp;**July** 

- Our paper *"Rigorous Probabilistic Guarantees for Robust Counterfactual Explanations"* in collaboration with <a href='https://fraleo.github.io'>Francesco Leofante</a> of <a href='https://www.imperial.ac.uk/explainable-artificial-intelligence/'> Centre for Explainable AI </a> at Imperial College has been accepted at the 27th <a href='https://www.ecai2024.eu'> European Conference on Artificial Intelligence</a> (ECAI 2024) ðŸŽ‰. See you in Santiago de Compostela!

&emsp;**June** 

- Two new papers produced during the research period at CMU are now available in pre-print!
    - <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.08315'>Improving Policy Optimization via Îµ-Retrain</a>. Happy to have collaborated with <a href='https://emarche.github.io'>Enrico Marchesini</a> and <a href='https://priyadonti.com'>Prof. Priya Donti</a> of the Laboratory for Information & Decision Systems at MIT for this project!

    - <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01639'>ModelVerification.jl</a>: the first Julia cutting-edge toolbox that contains a suite of state-of-the-art methods for verifying DNNs.


&emsp;**January** 

- Our paper *"Enumerating Safe Regions in Deep Neural Networks with Provable Probabilistic Guarantees"* has been selected for an oral presentation at <a href='https://aaai.org/aaai-conference/'>AAAI</a> 2024 ðŸ¤©.
