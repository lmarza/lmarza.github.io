  abstract={Although recent provable methods have been developed to compute preimage bounds for neural networks, their scalability is fundamentally limited by the #P-hardness of the problem. In this work, we adopt a novel probabilistic perspective, aiming to deliver solutions with high-confidence guarantees and bounded error. To this end, we investigate the potential of bootstrap-based and randomized approaches that are capable of capturing complex patterns in high-dimensional spaces, including input regions where a given output property holds. In detail, we introduce *R*andom *F*orest *Pro*perty *Ve*rifier (RF-ProVe), a method that exploits an ensemble of randomized decision trees to generate candidate input regions satisfying a desired output property and refines them through active resampling. Our theoretical derivations offer formal statistical guarantees on region purity and global coverage, providing a practical, scalable solution for computing compact preimage approximations in cases where exact solvers fail to scale.},

      author={Marzari, Luca and Cicalese, Ferdinando and Farinelli, Alessandro and Amato, Christopher and Marchesini, Enrico},
      abstract={Ensuring safety in reinforcement learning (RL) is critical for deploying agents in real-world applications. During training, current safe RL approaches often rely on indicator cost functions that provide sparse feedback, resulting in two key limitations: (i) poor sample efficiency due to the lack of safety information in neighboring states, and (ii) dependence on cost-value functions, leading to brittle convergence and suboptimal performance. After training, safety is guaranteed via formal verification methods for deep neural networks (FV), whose computational complexity hinders their application during training. We address the limitations of using cost functions via verification by proposing a safe RL method based on a violation value—the risk associated with policy decisions in a portion of the state space. Our approach verifies safety properties (i.e., state-action pairs) that may lead to unsafe behavior, and quantifies the size of the state space where properties are violated. This violation value is then used to penalize the agent during training to encourage safer policy behavior. Given the NP-hard nature of FV, we propose an efficient, sample-based approximation with probabilistic guarantees to compute the violation value. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks and real-world robotic navigation tasks show that violation-augmented approaches significantly improve safety by reducing the number of unsafe states encountered while achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.},

      abstract={Variational quantum circuits (VQCs) are a central component of many quantum machine learning algorithms, offering a hybrid quantum-classical framework that, under certain aspects, can be considered similar to classical deep neural networks. A shared aspect is, for instance, their vulnerability to adversarial inputs, small perturbations that can lead to incorrect predictions. While formal verification techniques have been extensively developed for classical models, no comparable framework exists for certifying the robustness of VQCs. Here, we present the first in-depth theoretical and practical study of the formal verification problem for VQCs. Inspired by abstract interpretation methods used in deep learning, we analyze the applicability and limitations of interval-based reachability techniques in the quantum setting. We show that quantum-specific aspects, such as state normalization, introduce inter-variable dependencies that challenge existing approaches. We investigate these issues by introducing a novel semantic framework based on abstract interpretation, where the verification problem for VQCs can be formally defined, and its complexity analyzed. Finally, we demonstrate our approach on standard verification benchmarks.},

      title={Advancing Neural Network Verification through Hierarchical Safety Abstract Interpretation}, 
      author={Luca Marzari and Isabella Mastroeni and Alessandro Farinelli},
      abstract={Traditional methods for formal verification (FV) of deep neural networks (DNNs) are constrained by a binary encoding of safety properties, where a model is classified as either safe or unsafe (robust or not robust). This binary encoding fails to capture the nuanced safety levels within a model, often resulting in either overly restrictive or too permissive requirements. In this paper, we introduce a novel problem formulation called Abstract DNN-Verification, which verifies a hierarchical structure of unsafe outputs, providing a more granular analysis of the safety aspect for a given DNN. Crucially, by leveraging abstract interpretation and reasoning about output reachable sets, our approach enables assessing multiple safety levels during the FV process, requiring the same (in the worst case) or even potentially less computational effort than the traditional binary verification approach. Specifically, we demonstrate how this formulation allows rank adversarial inputs according to their abstract safety level violation, offering a more detailed evaluation of the model's safety and robustness. Our contributions include a theoretical exploration of the relationship between our novel abstract safety formulation and existing approaches that employ abstract interpretation for robustness verification, complexity analysis of the novel problem introduced, and an empirical evaluation considering both a complex deep reinforcement learning task (based on Habitat 3.0) and standard DNN-Verification benchmarks.},

In this paper, we propose a hierarchical control framework leveraging neural network verification techniques to design control barrier functions (CBFs) and policy correction mechanisms that ensure safe reinforcement learning navigation policies. Our approach relies on probabilistic enumeration to identify unsafe regions of operation, which are then used to construct a safe CBF-based control layer applicable to arbitrary policies. We validate our framework both in simulation and on a real robot, using a standard mobile robot benchmark and a highly dynamic aquatic environmental monitoring task. These experiments demonstrate the ability of the proposed solution to correct unsafe actions while preserving efficient navigation behavior.

  abstract={Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are powerful tools that have shown extraordinary results in many scenarios, ranging from pattern recognition to complex robotic problems. However, their intricate designs and lack of transparency raise safety concerns when applied in real-world applications. In this context, Formal Verification (FV) of DNNs has emerged as a valuable solution to provide provable guarantees on the safety aspect. Nonetheless, the binary answer (i.e., safe or unsafe) could be not informative enough for direct safety interventions such as safety model ranking or selection. To address this limitation, the FV problem has recently been extended to the counting version, called #DNN-Verification, for the computation of the size of the unsafe regions in a given safety property's domain. Still, due to the complexity of the problem, existing solutions struggle to scale on real-world robotic scenarios, where the DNN can be large and complex. To address this limitation, inspired by advances in FV, in this work, we propose a novel strategy based on reachability analysis combined with Symbolic Linear Relaxation and parallel computing to enhance the efficiency of existing exact and approximate FV for DNN counters. The empirical evaluation on standard FV benchmarks and realistic robotic scenarios shows a remarkable improvement in scalability and efficiency, enabling the use of such techniques even for complex robotic applications.},

  journal={International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI)},
  abstract={The increasing use of Machine Learning (ML) models to aid decision-making in high-stakes industries demands explainability to facilitate trust. Counterfactual Explanations (CEs) are ideally suited for this, as they can offer insights into the predictions of an ML model by illustrating how changes in its input data may lead to different outcomes. 
   However, for CEs to realise their explanatory potential, significant challenges remain in ensuring their robustness under slight changes in the scenario being explained. Despite the widespread recognition of CEs' robustness as a fundamental requirement, a lack of standardised tools and benchmarks hinders a comprehensive and effective comparison of robust CE generation methods. In this paper, we introduce RobustX, an open-source Python library implementing a collection of CE generation and evaluation methods, with a focus on the robustness property. RobustX provides interfaces to several existing methods from the literature, enabling streamlined access to state-of-the-art techniques. The library is also easily extensible, allowing fast prototyping of novel robust CE generation and evaluation methods.},

  abstract={The field of robotic Flexible Endoscopes (FEs) has progressed significantly, offering a promising solution to reduce patient discomfort. However, the limited autonomy of most robotic FEs results in non-intuitive and challenging manoeuvres, constraining their application in clinical settings. While previous studies have employed lumen tracking for autonomous navigation, they fail to adapt to the presence of obstructions and sharp turns when the endoscope faces the colon wall. In this work, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based navigation strategy that eliminates the need for lumen tracking. However, the use of DRL methods poses safety risks as they do not account for potential hazards associated with the actions taken. To ensure safety, we exploit a Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) method to restrict the policy in a predefined safety regime. Moreover, we present a model selection strategy that utilises Formal Verification (FV) to choose a policy that is entirely safe before deployment. We validate our approach in a virtual colonoscopy environment and report that out of the 300 trained policies, we could identify three policies that are entirely safe. Our work demonstrates that CRL, combined with model selection through FV, can improve the robustness and safety of robotic behaviour in surgical applications.},

  abstract={Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become a dominant deep-learning paradigm for tasks where complex policies are learned within reactive systems. Unfortunately, these policies are known to be susceptible to bugs. Despite significant progress in DNN verification, there has been little work demonstrating the use of modern verification tools on real-world, DRL-controlled systems. In this case study, we attempt to begin bridging this gap, and focus on the important task of mapless robotic navigation — a classic robotics problem, in which a robot, usually controlled by a DRL agent, needs to efficiently and safely navigate through an unknown arena towards a target. We demonstrate how modern verification engines can be used for effective model selection, i.e., selecting the best available policy for the robot in question from a pool of candidate policies. Specifically, we use verification to detect and rule out policies that may demonstrate suboptimal behavior, such as collisions and infinite loops. We also apply verification to identify models with overly conservative behavior, thus allowing users to choose superior policies, which might be better at finding shorter paths to a target. To validate our work, we conducted extensive experiments on an actual robot, and confirmed that the suboptimal policies detected by our method were indeed flawed. We also demonstrate the superiority of our verification-driven approach over state-of-the-art, gradient attacks. Our work is the first to establish the usefulness of DNN verification in identifying and filtering out suboptimal DRL policies in real-world robots, and we believe that the methods presented here are applicable to a wide range of systems that incorporate deep-learning-based agents.},

    author={Marchesini*, Enrico and Marzari*, Luca and Farinelli, Alessandro and Amato, Christopher}, 
    abstract={Cost functions are commonly employed in Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). However, the cost is typically encoded as an indicator function due to the difficulty of quantifying the risk of policy decisions in the state space. Such an encoding requires the agent to visit numerous unsafe states to learn a cost-value function to drive the learning process toward safety. Hence, increasing the number of unsafe interactions and decreasing sample efficiency. In this paper, we investigate an alternative approach that uses domain knowledge to quantify the risk in the proximity of such states by defining a violation metric. This metric is computed by verifying task-level properties, shaped as input-output conditions, and it is used as a penalty to bias the policy away from unsafe states without learning an additional value function. We investigate the benefits of using the violation metric in standard Safe DRL benchmarks and robotic mapless navigation tasks. The navigation experiments bridge the gap between Safe DRL and robotics, introducing a framework that allows rapid testing on real robots. Our experiments show that policies trained with the violation penalty achieve higher performance over Safe DRL baselines and significantly reduce the number of visited unsafe states.},

However, such properties are hard-coded and require task-level knowledge, making their application intractable in challenging safety-critical tasks. To this end, we introduce the Collection and Refinement of Online Properties (CROP) framework to design properties at training time. CROP employs a cost signal to identify unsafe interactions and use them to shape safety properties. Hence, we propose a refinement strategy to combine properties that model similar unsafe interactions.Our evaluation compares the benefits of computing the number of violations using standard hard-coded properties and the ones generated with CROP. We evaluate our approach in several robotic mapless navigation tasks and demonstrate that the violation metric computed with CROP allows higher returns and lower violations over previous Safe DRL approaches.},
