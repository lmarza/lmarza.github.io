      work_title: Understanding Deep Neural Networks through Formal Verification for Improved Safety and Robustness
      abstract: Deep Neural Networks are typically considered as "black box". However, Formal Verification (FV) could be used to formally analyze these networks to find patterns or yet-ununderstood properties of these complex non-linear functions. In particular, My Ph.D. focuses on understand how we can leverage FV techniques to study the behavior of neural networks even before the training phase.

      year: 10/2020 - 07/2022
      work_title: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Robotic Tasks Enhancing Efficiency and Safety
      abstract: The work aimed to investigate the improvement in performance of an Deep Reinforcement Learning informed training methodology combining Curriculum Learning, Transfer of Learning and fine-tuning techniques compared to a classic End-to-End uninformed methodology in a mapless navigation context, with a particular focus on the safety aspect. The thesis work has been published at SAC IRMAS, 2022.
    
    - title: B.Sc. in Computer Science
