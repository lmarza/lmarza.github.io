I am a second-year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Verona, advised by [Prof. Alessandro Farinelli](http://profs.sci.univr.it/~farinelli/) and [Prof. Ferdinando Cicalese](http://profs.scienze.univr.it/~cicalese/). I am also a visiting researcher in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), under the supervision of [Prof. Changliu Liu](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cliu6/).


My **Research Interests** focus on developing efficient and reliable methods for provably verifying the correctness of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), particularly in the context of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) applications. I am also developing approximation algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees to bridge the gap between Formal Verification of DNNs and safe DRL. 
You can visit the [publications page](https://lmarza.github.io/publications/) for more information on my research activity.

Outside of work, I am a rock climber🧗🏻 and I also love hiking⛰️ and [photography](https://www.juzaphoto.com/me.php?l=it&p=111136)📸.
