I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Verona, advised by [Prof. Alessandro Farinelli](http://profs.sci.univr.it/~farinelli/) and [Prof. Ferdinando Cicalese](http://profs.scienze.univr.it/~cicalese/). Recently, I've also been a visiting researcher in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), under the supervision of [Prof. Changliu Liu](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cliu6/).


My **research interests** focus on developing efficient and reliable methods for verifying and enhancing the explainability of deep neural networks (DNNs). I have also designed probabilistic verification algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees to bridge the gap between formal verification and safe deep reinforcement learning. The outcomes of my work have led to several publications in top-tier international conferences and journals in Artificial Intelligence and Verification, and to prestigious collaborations with world-leading universities.
You can visit the [publications page](https://lmarza.github.io/publications/) for more information on my research activity.

Outside of work, I am a rock climber🧗🏻 and I also love hiking⛰️ and [photography](https://www.juzaphoto.com/me.php?l=it&p=111136)📸.
