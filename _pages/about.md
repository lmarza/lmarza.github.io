I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Verona, advised by [Prof. Alessandro Farinelli](http://profs.sci.univr.it/~farinelli/) and [Prof. Ferdinando Cicalese](http://profs.scienze.univr.it/~cicalese/). Currently, I'm also a visiting researcher in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), under the supervision of [Prof. Changliu Liu](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cliu6/).


My **Research Interests** focus on developing efficient and reliable methods for verifying the correctness of DNNs, particularly in the context of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) applications. I am also exploring the use of approximate verification techniques inside the DRL training process, in order to foster the learning of safer behaviors.
For more information on my research activity, you can visit the [publications page](https://lmarza.github.io/publications/).
