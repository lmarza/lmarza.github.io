I am a third-year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Verona, advised by [Prof. Alessandro Farinelli](http://profs.sci.univr.it/~farinelli/) and [Prof. Ferdinando Cicalese](http://profs.scienze.univr.it/~cicalese/). Recently, I've also been a visiting researcher in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), under the supervision of [Prof. Changliu Liu](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cliu6/).


My **Research Interests** focus on developing efficient and reliable methods for verifying and enhancing the explainability of deep neural networks (DNNs). I also developed probabilistic verification algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees to bridge the gap between Formal Verification of DNNs and safe deep reinforcement learning. The results of my research resulted in several publications at top-level international conferences and prestigious collaborations with world-leading universities. 
You can visit the [publications page](https://lmarza.github.io/publications/) for more information on my research activity.

Outside of work, I am a rock climber🧗🏻 and I also love hiking⛰️ and [photography](https://www.juzaphoto.com/me.php?l=it&p=111136)📸.
